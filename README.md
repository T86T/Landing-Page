# Landing-Page
Project: Landing Page. Part of The Odin Project.

Introduction
For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

Do not be afraid to use google or go back to previous lessons to look something up. Real-life, professional developers use google constantly for things that they have been doing for years. At this point it is not expected that you will have everything memorized, so don’t worry about it. Additionally, there are a few small details that you may not have encountered in our lessons yet. This is by design. These details are minor, and easily searched (e.g. google css rounded corners).

Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It doesn’t matter if you use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 48px.

Finally, feel free to substitute your own content into this design. The images have some meaningless dummy content, but if you want to make up a business and personalize this page, please feel free to do so! Insert actual images in the placeholders, and feel free to play with the colors and fonts a bit too.
